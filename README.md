# 📉 Binary Sequence Divergence

**Binary Sequence Divergence** is a quantitative analysis tool that identifies percentage deviations in binary sequences using sliding windows, aiming to study patterns and trends in simple data like `0`s and `1`s.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Provide a **long binary sequence** (e.g., `010101001100...`);
2. Choose a **sliding window size** (e.g., 120 bits);
3. The tool will move the window across the sequence and:
   - Calculate the **percentage difference** between zeros and ones;
   - Track how the distribution shifts over time;
   - Optionally analyze the effect of that shift in the next N steps.

## 🎓 Use Case

Originally designed for **educational purposes**, this project explores how simple binary data can demonstrate **pseudo-trends** and **statistical deviations** — concepts applicable to finance, signal processing, and algorithmic research.
